# Reinforcement learning algorithm implemented for CartPole on OpenAI gym.

Implementation of Policy Gradient methods for a simple Reinforcement Learning problem (CartPole: https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0). The problem consists of balancing a pole connected with one joint on top of a moving cart. The only actions are to add a force of -1 or +1 to the cart, pushing it left or right. The goal is to learn to simulate the action of balancing a cartpole for maximal number of time steps.
